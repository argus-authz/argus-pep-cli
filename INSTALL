PEP-C command line interface (pepcli)
-------------------------------------

1. First you have to bootstrap the autotools:

./autotools.sh

2. Then use configure (default prefix: /opt/glite):

./configure 

or if you want to install the lib and include in a different directory:

./configure --prefix=/other/directory

3. Build the library:

make

and install it:

make install

4. you are all done :)

The pepcli command is now installed in <prefix>/bin and the man page pepcli(1) is available. 

Dependencies - see DEPENDENCIES file.
